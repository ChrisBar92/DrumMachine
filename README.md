This is a project that simulates playing drums. All buttons were created in JS for better understanding and practice of this language. 
There are two options for playing. You can press the buttons on the keyboard, or you can click on individual buttons with the mouse. 
The buttons on the gray background are just a brief instruction - they are not active. 
The app is responsive and also works on mobile devices. Below are screen shots of how it looks on desktop and mobile.
